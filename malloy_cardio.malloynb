## Step 0: Get Ready 

The first step in any Malloy data modeling exercise is to declare your sources. In the following code cell, declare a source for each of the tables in the ecommerce dataset. Refer to the [documentation for the precise syntax](https://malloydata.github.io/documentation/language/source).
>>>malloy
// users table at data/users.parquet
source: users is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/users.parquet')

// Create a source for the rest of the tables in this dataset:

// products
source: products is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/products.parquet')

// orders
source: orders is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/orders.parquet') {
  join_one: users on user_id = users.user_id
}

// items
source: items is duckdb.table('data/ecommerce/items.parquet') {
  join_one: orders on order_id = orders.order_id
  join_one: products on product_id = products.product_id
}

query: category_by_brand_revenue is items -> {
    group_by: products.category
    nest: by_brand is {
        group_by: products.brand
        aggregate: revenue is sum(sale_price)
        limit: 5
    }
}

## Step 1: Warmup

Simple queries are easy to write in Malloy. The following query looks at the count of users by gender:
>>>malloy
run: users -> {
  group_by: gender
  aggregate: user_count is count()
}
>>>markdown
Now your turn to try. Write a query that calculates the count of orders by status.
>>>malloy
// Calculate the count of orders by status:

run: orders -> {
    group_by: status
    aggregate: order_count is count()
}
>>>markdown
## Step 2: Joins
In this data model, `items` and `orders` are related fact tables, and the `users` and `products` tables are dimensions that join in. Update the sources above to include these joins:
- `items` joins to `orders` via `order_id`
- `items` joins to `products` via `product_id`
- `orders` joins to `users` via `user_id`
>>>markdown
## Step 3: Using Joins
Now that we have the joins modeled, let's run a query that takes advantage of them. For each product category, find the average age of users who ordered from that category.
>>>malloy
// Compute the average age of users who ordered from each category
run: items -> {
    group_by: products.category
    aggregate: age_avg is avg(orders.users.age)
    
}
>>>markdown
## Step 4: Calculating Percent of Total
Malloy makes "percent of total" calculations very easy. For each product category, what is the total revenue, and calculate the percent of overall revenue.
>>>malloy
// Compute revenue for each product category, as well as percent of revenue relative to overall

run: items -> {
    group_by: products.category
    aggregate: 
    revenue is sum(sale_price)
    # percent
    percent is sum(sale_price) / all(sum(sale_price))
}
>>>markdown
## Step 6: Nested Query
The above query shows us revenue numbers per product category. Let's drill in deeper with a nested query. Can you add a `nest` to this query to show the top 5 brands by revenue for each category?
>>>malloy
// For each product category, show top 5 brands by revenue
run: items -> {
    group_by: products.category
    nest: by_brand is {
        group_by: products.brand
        aggregate: revenue is sum(sale_price)
        limit: 5
    }
}
>>>markdown
## Step 8: Saving this query
Update the data model to save the "top brands" query directly onto the source. Now modify what you previously wrote to use this saved query.
>>>malloy
// Update what you previously wrote to use a saved query from the Source
run: category_by_brand_revenue
>>>markdown
## Step 9: Refining a Saved Query
Try using a query refinement to take the analysis further. Perhaps you can filter to only look at top brands where the `department` is Men or Women? Or perhaps you want to only look at brands with products above a certain `retail_price` threshold?
>>>malloy
// Update this query again to include a refinement
run: items -> {
    group_by: products.category
    where: products.department = "Women"
    nest: by_brand is {
        group_by: products.brand
        aggregate: revenue is sum(sale_price)
        limit: 5
    }
}

run: items -> {
    group_by: products.category
    where: products.retail_price > "100"
    nest: by_brand is {
        group_by: products.brand
        aggregate: revenue is sum(sale_price)
        limit: 5
    }
}
>>>markdown
## Step 10: Keep Exploring!
There are a handful of other datasets in this repository that are ready for modeling, exploration, and analysis. Take what you've learned here and try to apply it to another dataset in the `data` subfolder. Or better yet, find a dataset relevant to your day-to-day work and use Malloy to model and analyze it!
